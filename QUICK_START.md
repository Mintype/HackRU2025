# Quick Start: Upgrading Your Lessons

## What Was Done
Your lessons have been dramatically improved with:
- ðŸŽ“ New "teaching" activity type that teaches before testing
- ðŸ“š Lessons are now 3x longer (12-15 activities each)
- âœ… All vocabulary is now taught
- ðŸ”„ Proper learning flow: teach â†’ practice â†’ review

## How to Apply These Changes

### 1. Generate the Enhanced Lessons
```powershell
cd c:\Users\900ra\Documents\programming\HackRU\sitee\scripts
python enhanced_chinese_lessons.py
```

**What this does**: Creates a new `chinese_data.json` file with all the enhanced lessons.

### 2. Upload to Database
```powershell
python main.py
```

**What this does**: Uploads the enhanced lessons to your Supabase database.

### 3. Test It Out!
Open your app and try a Chinese lesson. You should see:
- Teaching activities with nice gradient cards
- "Continue" button on teaching activities
- Much longer lessons
- All vocabulary taught before being tested

## Files Modified

### Frontend
- âœ… `src/app/lessons/[id]/page.tsx` - Now supports teaching activities

### Documentation  
- âœ… `LESSON_ACTIVITIES_README.md` - Documents the new teaching activity type

### Lesson Content
- âœ… `scripts/enhanced_chinese_lessons.py` - Script to generate enhanced lessons
- ðŸ”„ `scripts/chinese_data.json` - Will be updated when you run the script

## Rollback (if needed)
If you want to go back to the original lessons:
```powershell
# The original file is still there, just run main.py with the old data
# Or you can manually restore from git history
```
